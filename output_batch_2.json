However, three shops on the same street have resulted in destructive competition. Read more about how Lung Kau, Fok Siu Yuk, and Kam Chi are their wives, respectively. They often quarrel as they earnestly defend their husbands. The siblings’ mother, Madam Man Ji Chin Hung, has not intervened in the feud between her three sons as she is faced with a dilemma. \n\nJust before CNY’s Eve, Chin Hung sees her late husband in her dream. He brings up the topic of sibling rivalry and tells Chin Hung to restore things to order. Chin Hung then uses the legend of the Mans’ Golden Bowl, which was bestowed by the Emperor, as an excuse for luring her three sons into temporarily staying at their old home from the first to the seventh of January. Chin Hung pretends to observe her sons' and their family members’ behavior, which she uses as a basis for deciding who is the Golden Bowl winner. In fact, she hopes to unite everybody through the participation of the three families in traditional CNY activities.\n\n(Source: TMDb)",

Nevertheless, there’s one thing that Go has always been wholeheartedly devoted to movies.

      "synopsis": "The 1st day when Jeannie and Simon decided to get married, they couldn’t find a place to get intimate. That’s Hong Kong for you – getting married so that a couple can have a place to be intimate. The traditional marriage ceremony is considered old-fashioned and cringe-worthy in the 21st century, but it’s only supposed to happen once in your life, so people savour it anyway. And so, the marriage begins out of love, but this is the beginning of many challenges to come.\n\nOne day, Jeannie realized that the person closest to her had become a stranger. She feels that her ideologies no longer align with those of Simon and starts to feel ashamed of herself. She feels that her whole life revolves around Simon, and without him, she lacks purpose. And so, she decided to leave him, but she didn’t realize that this parting would be more painful than death. In the end, she signs the divorce papers nonetheless.\n\nThree years later, Simon comes back to her; he’s run into a dead end, with his business collapsing. He needs her, but does she still love him? They end up back together, and one day, Simon is on the phone in the living room, and Jeannie is in the kitchen preparing lunch. Jeannie looks at Simon, and her heart shivers at the thought of the marriage coming full circle. It is all new, but it seems all too familiar…\n\n(Source: cinema.com.hk/en)\n\n~~ Release dates: Oct 27, 2021 (Festival) || Apr 27, 2023 (Cinema)",

As the college entrance examination resumed, Zhuang Chao Ying, a teacher, and his wife, Huang Ling, prioritized their children's exams as the family's top priority. Their neighbor, Lin Wu Feng, and his wife, Song Ying, also began to pay attention to their son's studies due to their influence.\n\nThe Zhuang family appeared harmonious and respectable, with their son Zhuang Tu Nan being diligent and studious and their daughter Zhuang Xiao Ting being well-behaved and sensible. However, Zhuang Chao Ying's cowardice and foolish filial piety caused harm to his family. In contrast, the Lin family seemed to live according to their own rules, with their son Lin Dong Zhe being exceptionally mischievous.\n\nIn reality, the couple supported each other, and there was mutual respect between parents and children, creating a lively and fulfilling family atmosphere. Adapting to the changes of the times, Lin Wu Feng and Song Ying moved the whole family to Guangzhou to seek new opportunities.\n\nAfter separating from childhood friends Zhuang Xiao Ting and Lin Dong Zhe, they realized their feelings for each other and agreed to enroll in the same university. Upon graduation, despite facing obstacles from family and reality, they firmly chose each other. After many twists and turns, Zhuang Tu Nan and Li Jia also eventually became a couple.\n\n(Source: Chinese = Baidu || Translation = MyDramaList)\n\n~~ Adapted from the web novel \"Xiao Xiang Ren Jia\" (小巷人家) by Da Mi (大米).\n~~ Two versions available: 40 episodes (Online) || 47 episodes (TV)",

      "synopsis": "In the late 1990s, Liu Jun, who studied in Germany, returned to his hometown of Donghai. Following the tide of the times, he is determined to modernize his father's old machinery factory with leading technology. \n\nAs a private enterprise, Liu Jun struggles to acquire capital, connections, and technology. However, his friend Qian Hong Ming's import and export as well as real estate businesses are flourishing at this time and the two come to look out for each other.\n\nLiu Jun becomes acquainted with Yang Xun due to technology, yet their falling out is also because of the same. Fortunately, Song Yun Hui, the head of the Donghai Group, favors Liu Jun and provides strong backing for the development of the Tengfei Factory.\n\nDespite his skills, Liu Jun remains down-to-earth as he adapts to the local environment while attempting to break through technical barriers. While working hard to complete the transformation of the Tengfei Factory, Liu Jun realizes his own value. Tengfei Factory also strives to lead the torrent of China's manufacturing industry.\n\n(Source: ChineseDrama.info)\n\n~~ Adapted from the web novel \"Jian Nan De Zhi Zao\" (艰难的制造) by A Nai (阿耐).",

      "synopsis": "Tadashi is about to take his final school examinations. Unbeknown to anyone, he has fallen in love with his fellow pupil, Kota, and doesn’t dare to tell anyone. One hot summer’s day, some of the other schoolboys taunt him, calling him a ponce. This destroys all hope he ever had of getting together with Kota.\n\nThoroughly depressed, Tadashi meets a gay couple on the train. Hiroki and Sinji are fascinating; their conversation is so stimulating that, before he realises what he is doing, he decides to follow them.\n\nIt is completely irrelevant how old you are and how often it happens to you; falling in love is always just like the first time. HATSU-KOI tells a story about coming of age, coming out and a gay marriage that is sprinkled with both love and hard-core sex, at the centre of which is a teenager who doesn’t yet know what he wants.\n\n(Source: Berlin Film Festival)",

Setting out to conduct interviews with survivors and relatives, he finds the truth of the past to be elusive, achieving a breakthrough only when he confronts ex-Sergeant Yamada, who grudgingly admits the occurrence and instructional source of certain atrocities.

They were assigned to work in a special law enforcement operation to recover priceless heritage jewelries. The said jewels are believed to have been used as magical amulets of the legendary Hara Urduja.\n\nThe operation becomes more difficult because of their personal differences—Gem is a bit uptight while Crystal can be too spontaneous. But aside from their clashing personalities, they must also navigate through combat challenges and deadly opponents.\n\nInside the Kingdom of Tawalisi, lives Hara Urduja, a mystical warrior queen who rules an army of strong, skilful, and extraordinary women. She holds a big responsibility to lead her followers and maintain peace in their land. But will Hara Urduja be able to protect herself from people who want to dethrone her and use her power in vain?\n\n(Source: mb.com.ph)",

His son, triad head Yiu Tam  is now in charge, and must secure the safety of the triad from interlopers Uncle Nine and Kui. Meanwhile, cop Inspector Lau angles to bring Yiu down. Amidst this, Yiu's innocent brother, Shun Tam returns from America to visit his ailing father, only to find himself quickly drawn into the escalating violence of the triad underworld. Yiu acts to keep his brother safe, with trusted enforcer Ghostie acting as Shun's bodyguard. But Yiu may not be entirely on the level. Years ago, a fortune teller told Tin Tam that one of his sons would someday kill the other. To prevent that tragedy, Tin separated the two, but now that Shun and Yiu are back together, and with violence and betrayal surrounding them, it may only be a matter of time before the prophecy comes true. \n\n(Source:  YesAsia)",

At home, her parents’ son's preference leaves her earnings wasted on a lazy brother while she struggles alone. Overworked and neglected, she dies at 33.\n\nReborn eight years earlier, Jiang vows to live differently. Bound by a non-compete, she leaves her high-stress job to return to nannying—a simpler role she once did in college. Though early interviews falter as employers’ wives dismiss her for her youth and beauty, she eventually secures a two‑month contract with the wealthy Su couple, unaware they are the grandparents of Su Ling Yuan, the investment banker who once sought her out. This time, she is determined to prioritize herself.\n\n(Source: DramaChef at MyDramaList)",

She depends on fellow cop Chan Siu Sang, who is now her boyfriend, for support and a secure future, and hopes for him to get promoted soon. They plan to get married. The added pressure of waiting for a promotion and So Ngo depending on him gets to Siu Sang, and he finds some breathing room with Sum Yeo, his beautiful next-door neighbor whom he sees as a platonic friend. \n\nWhen So Ngo finds out that she cannot have any more children, she rethinks whether she and Siu Sang should really get married. With all the added pressure in their relationship, both decide to break up. Siu Sang finds relief in Sum Yeo, whom he dates briefly and soon marries. So Ngo starts a relationship with taxi driver Yeung Kwong Chiu, who thinks she looks like his dead wife.\n\nSam Yuen and Ching Fung also experience difficulties in their new marriage when San Yuan is transferred to the Special Police Unit and concentrates more on her career than on family, leaving Ching Fung alone at home. Feeling neglected by his wife, Fung develops a drinking problem, which leads to a one-night stand with a stranger. With their marriage in jeopardy, Sam Yuen further buries herself in her career, putting all her concentration into her current case regarding a serial psycho-sex offender taxi driver wanted by the cops. When Sam Yuen becomes the psycho-sex offender's next victim, Ching Fung is there for her to help her heal.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Someone named “Admin” adds them to a chat group and forces them to play a killing game. Before they find and remove “the target”, whose identity is unknown, anyone in the chat group who does not reply to other members’ messages will die instantly. Panic strikes as students in the class suddenly die one by one. Ho Hei Yin, a gentle and simple student, fights with “Admin” to protect his precious friends. \n\nIn order for the class to survive, Yeung Yuet Ying vows to uncover the identity of “Admin”, even if it means putting herself in danger. A cynical Shek Hiu Yeung aims to save as many classmates as possible by locating and removing \"the target” quickly. While the trio try to save others, some people show their true colours under pressure. One of them uses the game to kill others in order to win. Another one kills his friends brutally for revenge. One uses his friends as pawns in order to survive…The place where they should enjoy their youth is turned into a scene of carnage.",

      "synopsis": "The five girls' days with each other continued, and more difficulties came one after another, but fortunately, they knew each other well enough, and their feelings became increasingly deep, and they could support each other through these difficulties. While Ye Zhen Zhen was infatuated with scientific research, she was also frequently affected by Dai Wei's family. How to live a simple life had become a problem, but fortunately, her firm position was clear enough, and her family cared for her very much; she solved these difficulties. Fang Zhi Heng accidentally had a sister, which made her change a lot, and she gradually returned to the right track in life. \n\nZhu Zhe accumulated through years of struggle, completely relying on her own in Shanghai, and finally broke through the bottleneck of the cause. After a detour, He Min Hong left the 22nd floor and finally came back. She began to learn how to think, how to give, and how to get along with others. Yu Chu Hui forced herself to work hard by external power, gradually moving towards consciousness, rising steadily, and getting rid of the shackles of her birth. The trials and gifts of life would continue, but with the support and companionship of the 22nd-floor sisters, they could go forward and run all the way to happiness.\n\n(Source: WeTV Singapore)",

Kusakabe and Matsuura are childhood friends and also went to the same kendo training school. They were once bound by a firm friendship, but took different paths and fell out as a result of some incident. The rumours are that Shogen has incurred displeasure because he is hindering the rise of the lord of the domain. However, he is known to the public as an artist so it would look bad if he were publicly executed. Gengo, who has been ordered to handle it as a fight due to a personal grudge, searches for the place for Shogen to die. He decides to visit Shogen for the first time in 20 years. When the paths of the two men cross again as they approach old age, fate starts moving again.\n\n~~ Adapted from the 2007 historical novel \"Ginkan no Fu\" by Hamuro Rin.",

Xiao Jiu, who passed by the demon catcher, heard about A Bao's condition and felt that it was not a disease of detachment from the soul but that there was a monster making trouble, and he unveiled the list to cure A Bao. \n\nXiao Jiu discovered that A Bao could not sleep for a long time because he was addicted to his dream, and then entered A Bao's dream to find the source of A Bao's long sleep. But it turned out that she was incensed on the outskirts ten days ago, passing the willow forest outside the city, and was attracted by the willow demon of the millennium. The Willow Demon has no flesh and turns into the look of A Bao's admirable human handsome boy. He meets A Bao in a dream every day, making A Bao unconsciously addicted. \n\nIn order to stay close to Ah Bao, the willow demon determined to take Bai Gong Zi's body and seal Bai Gong Zi's soul in a blue bird's body. In order to save A Bao and Bai Gong Zi, Xiao Jiu went deep into the demon cave and launched a fight with Willow Demon.\n\n(Source: New Top Chinese Movies)",

      "synopsis": "In 2014, the United Progressive Party (UPP), the second largest opposition party at the time in South Korea, went through dissolution by the Constitutional Court’s ruling on the grounds of the case in 2013 where Lee Seokki, a UPP lawmaker, was charged and tried for treason conspiracy. One month later, the Supreme Court decided that Lee was not guilty. \n\nThis documentary is composed of interviews with the people directly affected by the dissolution of the party, people around them, and those who had followed the case. As we watch, the interviews reveal differences in people’s opinions and stances. By tracking on such different positions, public opinion, false information, and perceptions on the Constitution, democracy and North Korea, we come face to face with a belated question. What have we missed?\n\n(Source: Hancinema)",

Wondering whether things could get any worse, Gong Li soon learns the answer to that question when he unexpectedly finds himself tied up in a murder case alongside Zhou Yin Yuan. \n\nA psychology graduate living under the guise of an astrologer, Yin Yuan shouldn’t have been anyone’s choice for a scapegoat. But when circumstances bring her and Gong Li together at just the wrong time, the unlikely pair find themselves becoming just that. Framed for a murder they didn’t commit, the two must work together to find a way to prove their innocence. Unfortunately, every step they take seems to lead them deeper into what is quickly becoming a truly bizarre mystery. \n\nDesperate to prove their innocence, Gong Li and Yin Yuan agree that they need more than a little professional help. Working out a deal with the police investigating the case, will this unlikely duo find the answers they so desperately seek?\n\n(Source: Viki)",

      "synopsis": "One thousand years ago in Wiang Chai Chet Buri, Chao Luang Rangsiman arranges a weaving competition to select a wife, his Chao Nang Luang on the throne. On the day the textiles are to be presented, Anyanang Homnuan of Nakhon Pha Ngam is strangled to death just before the weaving is finished. All the killer left behind was the silk mark around her throat.\n\nOne thousand years later, ghost-enthusiast Achi is head of an online ghost-hunting program. He invites a team of friends Young Jae, Bambam, and Junior to Chiang Mai to make the show. He lies to his great-grandmother that he's come just for a visit, but she's doubtful and warns him not to enter the storage room. Her words have the opposite of their intended effect, though, and Achi enters the room where he finds a small, ancient bit of cloth. When he makes contact with it, the spirit of Anyanang Homnuan emerges and tells him that those who touch the cloth must find her killer within three days or perish. \n\nAchi and his friends must come together to solve the quest in order to save his life. \n\n(Source: Thai = SF Cinema || Translation and editing = MyDramaList)",

      "synopsis": "In his early years, Oda Nobunaga picked up the nickname of \"The Fool of Owari\" due to his bizarre behavior. He later married Nohime, but their relationship was not very good. Their marriage came about as a political marriage between hostile neighboring regions. Oda Nobunaga accepted Nohime as his wife with an arrogant, authoritative attitude. Meanwhile, Nohime has an unabashed attitude and easily clashes with her husband. They are like oil and water.\n\nOne day, Oda Nobunaga’s enemy Imagawa Yoshimoto attacks Owari with his vast army. \n\nOda Nobunaga is devastated by the overwhelming gap in military strength, but Nohime encourages Oda Nobunaga to not despair and fight against his rival. Oda Nobunaga and Nohime draw up a tactical plan to take on the much larger army. They soon make plans to unify the entire country, which has never been successfully done.\n\n(Source: AsianWiki)",

The family is shattered by the vicious cycle of domestic abuse. After a night of beating, Teresa, goaded by a friend, seeks TPO (Temporary Protection Order) from the court. TPO is a legal remedy that a woman can avail of under Republic Act 9262 (Violence Against Women and Children Law) to protect her and her child against anyone harming them. Teresa is granted the TPO against Miguel. But in this legal tug-of-war of familial rights, their son, JR, is ignored. Until he shows aggression in school. But Miguel's parents coax Miguel to file for child custody. Just like our legal system, the film slowly unravels their story. (Source: IMDb)",

Daniel was raised comfortably in the city by his father. Miguel, on the other hand, was taken by his mother who later changed his name to Elias. They relocated to a poor fishing village where they struggled to make ends meet.\n\nYears later, Daniel and Miguel/Elias were drawn together by their mutual affections: the father who brought them apart, the mother they yearn for, and the woman they both love.\n\n(Source: GMA Network Offical Website)",

      "synopsis": "Phetai is an archeologist. She always dreamed of herself in traditional clothing and in an incident where she is killed. She was contacted to go analyze an old artifact but found that the artifact was fake. She met Songhop who has the same face as the person who killed her in her dream. Because of this, she hated him immediately. Even though they hate each other, fate seemed to bring them together multiple times. Their fate connects to the legend of “Nak Usa”, a land under the protection of the Four clans of Serpents (Nak). Phetai and Songhop found a slab that acts as a door to the Nak Usa land. This information was leaked to Artifact collectors that wish to possess the treasures of the Nak Usa as well. Phetai and Songhop race against time in an adventure to find the treasures in Nak Usa. \n\n(Source: ช่อง8 :Thaich8 YouTube, edited by umasou007)",

Despite the many difficulties, he has kept his soft demeanor and gentle smile as well as his empathy for others. Whenever someone struggles, he is always one of the first volunteers to help.\n\nSolo, a freshman music student, has everything: money, fame, good looks. But he lacks a smile. After his mother’s early death, he lost his happiness. Nothing could fill this missing hole in him until one late rainy night he stumbles into a café for coffee. \n\nAt that moment, their two worlds collide. For a cup of hot milk and a warm smile, Solo returns to the cafe every night. And Gui finds himself waiting for his late-night visitor. Night after night, the young men continue meeting at the same spot and at the same time. As they see each other more frequently and their lives overlap, the two become one another's breath…a necessity, just like Oxygen. \n\n(Source: Soju at MyDramaList)\n\n~~ Adapted from the novel \"Oxygen\" written by Chesshire and illustrated by Suki.",

Therefore, Jie did not care about fame and fortune, so he secretly helped his friend He Shouxin to get Jinshi and then left after embarking on the road to becoming an official. Hou Jie and his brother Song Ajiu Lang travelled around the world, living a life of \"having wine now and getting drunk now\", living a carefree life.\n\nWith his clever mind and sophistical eloquence, Jie is at ease when encountering various green forest thieves or local bullies. At this time, God allowed him to meet a woman who changed his life - Linglong. Long, who has a mysterious identity, has a fierce temper and strong martial arts skills. He and Jie Duo had many enmities and relationships. \n\nTheir fates were intertwined, and they eventually became a couple. Jie embarked on the road of becoming a lawyer, and his reputation spread all over the country. There were numerous lawsuits, and clients and dignitaries came to his door in an endless stream. Jie, Niang Zi Long, brother Jiu, and maid Xiao Feng have become a team that can never solve any case. All unsolved cases, big and small, cannot escape their eyes.\n\n(Source: Chinese = Baidu || Translation = MyDramaList)",

Wanting to know the source of the rare plant, Nawa invites his friends Burin, Namwhan, Champagne, Fifa, et al. to travel through the western forest to meet with his relative Phi Sak who discovered the Chalawan plant. \n\nThey meet with the village leader Ongsu at the lagoon deep in the forest who tells them Phi Sak has already left. He also tells them that the Chalawan herb they're looking for is on an island far away. Importantly, gathering the herb can only be attempted at twilight.\n\nAs the journey of finding the Chalawan plant progresses, so too do the past relationships of each member. All the while, the darkness creeps up on them and they discover they're in danger of falling prey to an ancient crocodile.\n\n(Source: Thai = TrueID || Translation = MyDramaList and AllAboutOhmFluke on Twitter)",

After this incident, she takes back all hope of returning to the field when she gets an order to go undercover. She begins working as a secretary for Ilkwang Hitech under the name, Baek Jang Mi. She is joined by a single mother, Im Ye Eun, who has the beauty of a girl group member, and Hwang Mi Soon, a housewife of 18 years whose family believes her to be an insurance salesperson. These three women begin to work together. Meanwhile, Ilkwang Hitech’s CEO, Yoon Seok Ho, knew Chan Mi as his tutor and had a crush on her. He can’t help but think that his new secretary, who looks exactly like his first love but has a different name and age, is a bit suspicious.\n\n(Source: VIKI)",

A Liang had thought Danny would find a remote, hidden place in the mountains for them to manufacture drugs, not an mansion on the outskirts of town.\n\nSylvia, who works at a private club and often comes into contact with respected people in society, uses her connections to gain access to important equipment for drug manufacturing. But having been drinking all night, her tipsy demeanor makes A Liang uneasy. As he prepares to give up on their plans and leave, however, A-Liang is coaxed by Danny into staying.\n\n(Source: PTS Plus Youtube)",

An investigation in relation to the government commences as well as trials. The trial fires the Public Prosecutor General, team director, and others.

The appearance of Lei Lok Yee, a travel guru, adds to the conflict between Lun Lap Sun and Fong Ga Sheung.\n\nThe two boys later move in to live with Lei Lok Yee and her brother Lei Lok Tung. On the other hand, Lun Bak Foon, who has always hoped that Lun Lap Sun will take over his dried seafood business, is helpless upon learning about his son's work and relationship troubles. Fortunately, his sister Lun Ching Man and employee Man Wai Lan have been silently supporting him throughout the years.

But soon, Pei Rong begins to suspect that Xiao Wei is a demon in disguise and requests help from Pang Yong, who has always had feelings for Pei Rong, to help her. As Pang Yong begins to investigate Xiao Wei, he meets up with Xia Bing, and the two try to expose Xiao Wei with each other’s help. Xiao Wei falls in love with Wang Sheng but is unable to use her strong powers to win her heart. Angry by this, Xiao Wei casts a “painted skin” spell on Pei Rong to make the world believe that she is a demon.\n\n(Source: Viki)\n\n~~ Adapted from the story “Painted Skin” (画皮) of the collection “Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio” (聊斋志异) by Pu Song Ling (蒲松齡).",

      "synopsis": "Kwok Ho illegally crosses into HK with his pregnant wife. Lucky to reach HK alive, the couple are denied by his elder brother Kwok Ying, who is cheating Kwok Ho out of half of the inheritance. Ho gets the message - to be successful in HK, use any means possible. Eight years pass, and Ho has become a rich and successful gangster. His motivation, a burning desire to revenge the betrayal of his brother which has only increased over this time. He launches a plan to disgrace Ying and his wife. The plan succeeds, but Ying is a devious bastard, and he strikes back. In the cycle of revenge which follows, things don't go smoothly for either side. And Ho has other problems. Perhaps because of the rough crossing, or because her sister-in-law kicked her during pregnancy, Ho's wife gives birth to a mentally disabled son. Ho is so ashamed that he has the boy kept in an institution. And as the plotting and counterplotting becomes more intense, more and more people are drawn in, and many lives are either lost or destroyed or both. Ho is a man whose humanity has been corrupted and twisted by the desire for revenge who becomes and even exceeds the horrible people he hates. \n\n(Source:  HKMDB)",

But when the newly appointed Chief Constable, Huang She, sends Fei Ren into the unruly, lawless zone of Yijiang Palace City to find a missing undercover agent, things spiral far beyond anything he expected. By sheer accident, Fei Ren is dragged into the city by Murong Gongzi, a quirky underling of Ban Dou - the slick-tongued leader of the Banlong Sect. Though the city glitters with surface-level prosperity, four rival sects wage a hidden war for power in the shadows. \n\nLegend has it: the one who pulls the sacred sword shall marry Fu Ling, the poised and deadly eldest sister of the Xuyi Sect. Through a chaotic twist of fate, Fei Ren and Gongzi pull the sword out together, landing themselves in the middle of a matrimonial standoff as the two chosen son-in-law candidates.\n\nNow caught between romantic rivalry, secret identities, and sect sabotage, Fei Ren must navigate a maze of deceit, destiny, and danger - still tasked with finding the missing spy… and maybe surviving long enough to decide if marrying into chaos is really worth it.\n\n(Source: Chinese = TMDb || Translation = MyDramaList)",

      "synopsis": "Four young women begin life at university. Although they are firm friends, they are very different in almost every regard. Xia Lang Lang is tomboyish, obstinate, and supremely logical. But as she begins her tertiary educational journey, she discovers that she also has a softer side – and that romance might also play a role in her life. Meanwhile, Huang Fu Shu Min is always the heroine of her own story. Acting cute and dependent is her strong suit, and independence is not something she has ever been familiar with. But she soon understands that her university journey could well lead her on the path to independence.\n\nThen there’s Fan Xiao Yu, an intelligent young woman and a renowned beauty from a wealthy family. But she has always toed the line, respecting her family’s wishes, despite the fact that deep down, she wants to break free. When she begins to explore the world of business with a fellow student, she realizes that she might yet attain freedom – and maybe romance, too. Rounding off the quartet is Yang Jia Qian, who always gives off the impression of being mature beyond her years. But she has a range of hidden thoughts and feelings that are now ready to come to the fore now that she is no longer under the watchful eye of her family.\n\n(Source: Viki)",

Together, they support and redeem each other during troubled times. Jiang Yue Lou heads the Jingcheng Police Station and appears neither good nor evil. Yet smugglers tremble at the thought of him.\n\nWhile investigating an opium case in Hong Kong, Yue Lou encounters Yu Zhi, who learns that Yue Lou suffers from bipolar disorder. Although initially reluctant to undergo treatment, Yue Lou eventually opens up to Yu Zhi. Despite their differing values, they slowly become close friends. At this time, the secrets from the past start to bubble to the surface.\n\n(Source: ChineseDrama.info)",

Ryoji and Yoko, a landlord couple who kindly welcomed me, and Mio, a beautiful woman with a lonely expression, lived there.\"\n\nToyama was confused when he was greeted by \"I think he is a real family\" and decided to move in.\n\nOne day, Okazaki witnessed a quarrel between Mio and Okazaki and was upset with anger, saying, \"That's what I saw!\", While Mio has a strangely calm attitude. Toyama clearly begins to feel something is wrong with this condominium.\n\nThen, the next day, Okazaki was discovered, leaving behind the words, \"That, get out of the condominium!!!\" Tomiyama begins to investigate the inhabitants of the condominium with his colleague Chika at his mysterious death.",

      "synopsis": "A sports drama about a former national athlete who quits sports after causing a scandal and becomes a mental coach to help former professional athletes who have retired and current athletes who have fallen into a slump.\n\nJe Gal Gil is a former national Taekwondo athlete who is known for his hard work and dorky charms. After he causes an unprecedented accident in the athlete’s village, Je Gal Gil is permanently expelled and coined the unlucky Taekwondo prodigy. Once he overcomes his past trauma and regains his mental health, Je Gal Gil returns to the athlete’s village as a mental coach.\n\nCha Ga Eul is a former world-class short track speed skating gold medalist who has fallen into a slump. With her pretty poker face, she’s known as the up-and-coming “Ice Princess,” but she faces the danger of fading out when she falls into a slump. Unable to confide in anyone, Cha Ga Eul begins to beat herself up until she meets mental coach Je Gal Gil.\n\nGu Tae Man is the director of the Human Rights Center in the Korean Olympic Committee. The former Taekwondo Olympic gold medalist has a strong desire for power and is the reason Je Gal Gil’s life was transformed overnight. With the belief that anything can be covered as long as he is No. 1, Gu Tae Min does everything he can for the top position.\n\nPark Seung Ha is a part of the mental health support team in the athlete’s village. She is the perfect example of “a kind daughter who was raised well” but endures an unexpected hardship after meeting Je Gal Gil as her first patient. Park Seung Ha ends up leaving the hospital and applying to the athlete’s village instead where she surprisingly reunites with Je Gal Gil, this time as advisor partners.\n\n(Source: Naver; Soompi)",

Since Athit want to do farming, his father decided to send him to stay with Grandma Daeng, so that Athit can redeem his father's guilt.\nGrandma Daeng welcomed Athit because all her children got married and left home, and no one wanted to carry on the farming work from her. Therefore, Grandma Daeng made a deal with Athit that Grandma would support the money for Athit's siblings' education funds and Athit had to work without salary to repay for this debt and for his father's guilt in the past.\nGrandma Daeng treated Athit very well after she tested and trusted him. So, she decided to gave Athit her empty land to make it useful. Athit seemed to be Grandma Daeng's favourite grandson now.\nDarunee was a high-school girl and younger than Athit, but she was adopted to be Grandma Daeng's youngest sister, so her status was Athit's grand aunt. Since the first met, she had prejudice against Athit and thought that he was her enemy because she was jealous of him and feared that he would steal all Grandma Daeng's love from her. Athit also didn't give in to her, so they always quarreled and fought with each other. It made Grandma Daeng distressed. But as the years pass, Athit and Darunee's relationship starts changing.",

      "synopsis": "Saizo Yui is a single, 29-year-old woman who works in the crime laboratory at the Takanashi Police Station as a forensics examiner. She does her job well, due to her excellent memory and analytical mind. She prioritizes efficiency at her work. She also eschews the old-fashioned and traditional ways at the police station, like, working overtime or being liked by colleagues. She does have two close female colleagues at the police station. They are Kira Masumi and Motoyama Iori. \n\nKira Masumi works as a physician in the medical office, and Motoyama Iori works in the traffic department. Every Friday night, these 3 women gather at an izakaya pub and chat about everything, including work and relationships. One Friday night, during the course of their normal conversation, they talk about a case that detectives at the police station are having trouble solving. Since then, they have talked about difficult cases and tried to solve them using their respective talents.\n\n(Source: AsianWiki)",

They share surprising similarities in their lives but realize their reunion coincides with the anniversary of their friend's suicide due to past bullying they participated in. As they grapple with this realization, a terrifying coincidence unfolds.\n\n>> Story 2: \"Harareru!\" (貼られる!)\nShiina Tsuyoshi, a top banker highly trusted by his superiors and subordinates, questions a taxi fare and is immediately labeled as a \"fault-finding claimant.\" From that day on, he's shocked by the savage criticism and labels people plaster on him, contrasting with their expressed opinions.\n\n>> Story 3: \"Sutema no Onna\" (捨て魔の女)\nFemale announcer Toki Shiori, 29, feels impatient about her career but receives advice from a passing monk about giving up to gain. On the same day, her favorite dress shirt tears during a report, but she wins grade A beef in a lottery. Taking the monk's advice, she starts discarding precious belongings and eventually lands a good job.\n\n>> Story 4: \"Shachu no Dekigoto\" (車中の出来事)\nThree men ride together in the last carriage of a train during the Showa era around 30 years ago. Among them, a policeman escorts a delicate man while a pompous man sits nearby. Involved in a drug trafficking case, they engage in a battle of wits as the truth unfolds.\n\n(Source: MyDramaList)",

      "synopsis": "Controlled by a complex network of cells, each and every human on the planet is kept running by an unseen operating system that is, for the most part, completely ignored. Though humans never give much thought to how they manage to function, day in and day out, the cells within the human body are constantly at work, doing their part to keep their humans alive and well. This is why, on the outside, Kim Yu Mi may appear to be just like every other single working woman in the world, but underneath that ordinary exterior lies something truly extraordinary. \n\nHaving recently suffered a painful breakup, Yu Mi’s love cells have fallen into a deep coma. While the surrounding cells work hard to revive their fallen compatriots, Yu Mi spends her days stuck in the grind of everyday life. With a heart still broken and no romantic prospects, Yu Mi’s love cells might have been in serious trouble had it not been for the sudden appearance of Koo Ung. An emotionally stunted game developer, Koo Ung, has no idea how to express his true feelings, but after meeting Yu Mi, he finds himself wanting to try. With his own love cells unexpectedly sparking Yu Mi’s back to life, things between the two start to get interesting.  With both Yu Mi and Koo Ung’s cells working overtime, the two find themselves drawing ever closer. \n\nBut will the efforts of this small collection of cells really be enough to bring two hearts together forever?\n\n(Source: Viki)\n\n~~ Adapted from the webtoon \"Yumi's Cells\" (유미의 세포들) by Lee Dong Geon (이동건).",

With the eyes of the world constantly on him, Tae Seong does his best to keep a smile on his face and his temper in check. Seen by the people as a kind and polite young man, the only people who don’t buy into his whole good guy persona are those working for his management company.\n\nAs the head of that company’s PR team, O Han Byeol knows exactly what Tae Seong is really like. Well aware of his strong desire to win and his hot temper, Han Byeol has had to employ her excellent speech and crisis management skills on a number of occasions in order to keep Tae Seong’s reputation as spotless as it seems. Constantly bickering, there isn’t anyone in the world better suited to the role of natural enemies than Han Byeol and Tae Seong. \n\nForever at odds with each other, Tae Seong and Han Byeol seem destined to hate each other forever. But could the time they’re forced to spend together change those feelings, or will their mutual loathing last for all eternity?\n\n(Source: Viki)",

Her life has been dedicated to the study of martial arts, celebrating strength and valor. However, her world is turned upside down when her family arranges her marriage to Rong Yu, the heir to the esteemed Jialin National Astrology Hall.\n\nRong Yu couldn't be more different from He Jiu Ling. He is a soft-spoken, compassionate, highly educated, and academically inclined individual who abhors physical confrontation. The prospect of marrying what she perceives as a 'wimp' leaves He Jiu Ling aghast. Determined to thwart this arrangement, she devises a plan to sabotage the impending wedding.\n\nHowever, her carefully laid out scheme takes an unforeseen turn when a \"poison\" she intends to use to manipulate Rong Yu's mind goes awry, creating unexpected consequences. Now, He Jiu Ling faces a dilemma. Will this unlikely pair go through with the marriage, and could their chaotic circumstances unexpectedly lead to a blossoming romance?\n\n(Source: MyDramaList)",

A general’s daughter named Yuan Qing Li is traveling to a quiet nunnery to meditate in peace. However, a gang of bandits attacks her party, abducting her and leaving her unconscious.\n\nShe is rescued by benevolent forces but wakes up days later without any memories about the person she used to be, living a life that she does not believe to be her own. She also discovers that she is due to marry, something she does not want to do. She decides to run away and go undercover, disguising herself as a man. The martial arts skills she learned when she was younger soon come in handy, and she rises to the rank of county constable.\n\nMeanwhile, the Duke of Liang, Jing Ci, has also gone undercover as a lowly Liang official in a bid to expose a fiendish conspiracy that threatens to take down the government.  The duo teams up in a bid to put an end to the corruption and help Yuan Qing Li discover her true identity.\n\n(Source: Viki)\n\n~~ Adapted from the novel \"Liang Shi Huan\" (两世欢) by Ji Yue Jiao Jiao (寂月皎皎).",

This version remains the most famous version to date.\n\nThis popular Thai cult classic is about a cat with diamond eye. In order to protect itself when harmed, it will turn into a giant killer cat.   Only few people had an opportunity to come face to face with this supernatural cat. However, as the tales go, those who did will mysteriously meet a tragic end, die or become crazy except for one person, Busayamatr.  The cute diamond eye cat and Busayamatr first met when she was very young on one of her father's trip to the jungle many years ago.

Unfortunately, everybody died while trying to catch the cat to get its priceless diamond eye, including  Busayamart's father.   Only two people survived.  Busayamatr survived  because of her innocent heart that was pure and kind and the local man hired as navigator because he did not try to catch or harm the cat.    The local man ended up took the lost  young Busayamatr home and raised her as his daughter.  Since that day, the cat with diamond eye and Busayamatr became friends.  If and when  Busayamatr's in danger, her cute little pet black cat will turn into a giant evil black cat to protect her.",

Bo Ye Jing Xing will help Qing Liu recover his inner strength while he stays with him. \n\nMany days later, a beautiful woman is delivered to Qing Liu in a brocade box along with a manual and some rouge pills. Qing Liu pretends to be enamoured with her and keeps her as his concubine. The Jiang family and servants were perplexed by the demure-looking but uncouth woman. Bo Ye Jing Xing strives to uncover the truth about a massacre thirty years ago while entering into a romance with the young Qing Liu. As the truth resurfaces, so does the killer that Bo Ye Jing Xing has been searching for after all these years...\n\n(Source: AnastasiaWun at MyDramaList)\n\n~~ Adapted from the novel \"Yan Zhi Zhai\" (胭脂债) by Yi Du Jun Hua (一度君华).",

However, after defeating Engine-oh G9, Batcheed opens up a dimensional rift that sucks the Go-ongers and Engines to other Braneworlds. Soon after, while finding themselves fighting Ugatz, the Shinkengers encounter Go-on Red as he helps takes out the Ugatz on his own, much to the Shinkengers' shock. (Wikipedia)",

      "synopsis": "Near the end of 1990s, the forestry industry began to \"reduce production, limit logging, and lay off workers.\" For the first time, Gu Changshan's family and members of the 923 work team faced the choice of staying or leaving. \n\nGu Changshan has adopted Xingjie, the orphaned son of his late colleague who died on duty. Despite their initial hesitation, the Gu family decides to help Xingjie continue with his studies. Meanwhile, the layoff crisis among forestry workers gradually resolves itself as the younger workers became the first to leave. Gu Changshan leads the remaining people to participate in the \"family ecological forest\" project.\n\nIn 2007, in order to protect the ecology and improve people's livelihoods, the resettlement project in remote areas began, and the 923 team once again faced a tough choice. Xingjie is pulled back to the mountains as he takes over the task of mobilizing immigrants and bears the mission of forestry reform. Given the logging restrictions in 2014 and 2015, Xingjie actively responds to the call that \"gold and silver mines are not as good as blue waters and green mountains\" and leads the people towards a better life. \n\n(Source: ChineseDrama.info)",

However, there seemed to be a secret hidden in him. He learned mechanisms by himself, mastered yin yang theory and Eight-Trigrams, and even recast his broken arm.\n\nOne day, his stepsister, in debt from gambling, was hunted down by enemies. Both of them were forced to follow the creditor, Yuchi Ren, to break into the mysterious tomb for treasures to pay for her debt. The three of them found the clue to the Dragon Dungeon Coffin. When they were about to get the reward, they encountered a plague in the city, which caused the infected people to moult and become demonic monsters.\n\nFortunately, the rewarder of the ancient tomb told them that the Dragon Dungeon Coffin was related to the demonic monsters, and it could lead to the missing Tianji Sect and the treasures left by it. The rewarder hired the three of them with a great deal of money and found the Dragon Dungeon with the only clue: the demonic monsters. Following the horrible monster to their nest, all of them finally access the untraversed Tianji sacred land, but the real secret hidden in the Dragon Dungeon Coffin lets them realize that their horrific adventure has just begun...\n\n(Source: Youku)",

At the end of the 1970s, the Zhou family lived in a provincial city in the north. The father, Zhu Zhi Gang, has just participated in the Third Front Movement in Xi Nan. The eldest son, Zhou Bing Yi, responds to a national call to become part of the first batch of \"educated\" youths sent to live and work in rural areas. The eldest daughter, Zhou Rong, follows her poet husband to the countryside of Guizhou. The youngest son, Zhou Bing Kun, is the only one left at home with their mother.\n\nIn the span of 50 years, the Zhou family is swept by the tides of change in China. Zhou Bing Yi entered politics after graduating from university and experienced ups and downs in his career during the drastic reforms. Zhou Rong stays on to teach after receiving her Ph.D. She has a difficult love life and ends up living in France for twelve years. Zhou Bing Kun and Zheng Juan, a beautiful yet misfortunate women, develop romantic feelings for each other and continue to mature through their own efforts. Relatives and friends in the neighbourhood learn to move forward together. In fulfilling their own missions in life, the Zhou family represents an epic tale about contemporary Chinese people.\n\n(Source: ChineseDrama.info)\n\n~~ Adapted from the novel \"A Lifelong Journey\" (人世间) by Liang Xiao Sheng (梁晓声).",

As Aoyama's secrets are gradually revealed, Haruto, now the shop manager of an underground escort club, starts to question whether the man he loves is worth the wait; his feelings for escort Ruka have also evolved from mere compassion into something more. A mystery sex toy links the past and now of Aoyama, Shibahara, Ruka, and Haruto. A sudden murder then happens in 'Rain& Soda' as one of the escorts serves a customer. The murder horrifies the club, and the truth is soon to be brought under the light of this sensual world of sultriness.\n\n(Source: GagaOOLala)",

      "synopsis": "\"At Home Ka Dito\" marries a home makeover with a life-changing makeover: a makeover that goes beyond the physical. \n\nEach episode tells a story about a celebrity needing a makeover of any space in their home (or anyone related to it) and, in return for the space makeover mission that the show will conduct, the celebrity agrees to do charitable work for a person who is going through a hard time that the celebrity can relate to or be of assistance.\n\nCharlene Gonzalez anchors the show. Every episode kicks off with Charlene meeting Eugene Domingo to discuss the makeover mission for the day. They proceed to the celebrity's place. The teen pair is left to do the makeover with the aid of guest experts (for example, interior designers) and movers. They get to participate in the fun part of makeover activities (craft, carpentry, etc.) and impart practical tips to viewers.\n\nAs this unfolds in real-time, Charlene tags along with the celebrity to meet the chosen person who needs their help. They go through a step-by-step solution to the chosen person's problem (the range is wide: issues like dealing with teenage pregnancy, sibling rivalry, generation gap, insecurity, coping with the burden of being a breadwinner, etc.). The intercutting follow-through of the progress of the home and life-changing makeovers. \n\nThis culminates with a series of heart-rending reveals of surprises (mostly of wish-fulfilment related to the needs of the case study, ex. Kabuhayan Showcase) for the chosen person as they arrive at a solution. The celebrity is then surprised with the space makeover output, and the episode ends on a feel-good note.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

He has no father and no mother and lives a lonely life. His mentor, Qi Jing Chun, the foreign girl Ning Yao, and his friends Gu Can and Liu Xian Yang are his rare sustenance.\n\nRecently, the town has been different from usual. Not only have the dragon kilns closed one after another, but all kinds of foreigners have also poured in as if they are searching for treasures scattered all over the town. With the influx of more and more foreigners, Chen Ping An has been killed for no reason and involved in the crisis with Ning Yao. The two continued to repel the enemy and fell in love with each other. \n\nIn the mediation struggle, Chen Ping An gradually discovers the secrets of the town and the truth about the death of his parents. Under the influence of his mentor Qi Jing Chun, Chen Ping An finally chose to stand up for the injustice suffered by the town for three thousand years. Chen Ping An strives to comprehend the true meaning of swordsmanship, break free from the cage of fate, redeem himself and the people, and resolutely embarks on the road of wandering the world. \n\n(Source: Chinese = Weibo || Translation = MyDramaList)\n\n~~ Adapted from the web novel \"Jian Lai\" (剑来) by Feng Huo Xi Zhu Hou (烽火戏诸侯).",

While navigating the confines of this illusion, we meet people, form relationships, experience various emotions, learn about life and finally become an adult.\n\nThrough Seo Eun, the drama depicts how we reflect upon ourselves, overcome unexpected obstacles in life, and grow through relationships.

Every student there is a martial arts expert, so it is not surprising to see tea leaves moving in the shape of dragons or hallway windows shattering into bits with no one touching them.\n\nAt Volcano High, the legend of the Secret Manuscript - the one who inherits these writings will rule the world - has been continuously passed down. The Secret Manuscript is more famous because it helped the principal Jang Oh Ja calm 17 years of internecine feuding due to the privatization of schools. From the outside, Volcano High School seems peaceful. However, a bitter showdown for the Secret Manuscript is at hand. Among the challengers is the assistant principal who thirsts for the principal's position; Song Hak Rim, and Jang Ryang, captain of the weightlifting team who dreams of becoming the best at Volcano High.\n\nOn a windy, rainy day with thunder and lightning, Kim Kyung Soo transfers to Volcano High, his ninth school for he has been expelled from eight other schools because he cannot manage the power he is gifted with. Having become a problematic student despite his intentions, Kyung Soo is determined to graduate from Volcano High no matter what happens. Volcano High regards Kyung Soo as the eye of a hurricane. Will Kyung Soo manage to graduate in the middle of the violent storm caused by the battle for the Secret Manuscript?",

      "synopsis": "Psychological studies have found that repeating an action for twenty-one consecutive days can help change a person's behaviour, such as waking up early or exercising. The idea, extended to matters of love, evolves into the 21-Day Theory: the belief that if you pursue someone for twenty-one consecutive days, you'll win their heart. \n\nBut what happens when a woman uses the 21-Day Theory in an attempt to turn a gay man straight? \n\nThis story revolves around a woman with a crush on a wealthy and seemingly perfect man who's remained single for a long time. Rumours swirl about his sexual orientation, but she refuses to believe them. He never confirms or denies the speculation that he's gay. Determined to uncover the truth for herself, she employs the theory to pursue him. \n\n(Source: Change2561)",

      "synopsis": "Jameson, a native of Korea born in 1952, came to Korea, leaving his wife and daughter in Delhi, India. Two people who seem to have no contact met unexpectedly. Jameson, who visited the mill run by Im Soon for 30 years, is fascinated by the taste of Baekseolgi she made and wants to learn how to make rice cakes. It is clear that he was moved by the hard work of Im Soon, who has supported her family with all her might, not only because of the taste but also by protecting the space. \n\nIt is Im Soon's daughter who causes the current conflict. The daughter, who is uncomfortable with the fact that Jameson, who she does not know, even a foreigner, enters her mother's space, rejects Jameson and sees it. In addition, in this era, the mill is just a real estate sale that needs to be disposed of as soon as possible. This is probably the case when a perfect stranger recognizes the value of one's life more deeply than blood relatives. It is none other than Jameson and his family who understands and rewrites the surname “Jessi,” which Im Soon has lived with pride. In this way, Jessie's story expands and continues through completely different people.\n\n(Source: Korean = DFF, Daum || Translation = MyDramaList)",

      "synopsis": "Aikawa Kazuki is a university lecturer who teaches ethology, which is the study of animal behaviour. He has just started work as a lecturer at the recommendation of Professor Samejima Shun whom he studied under back in university. \n\nUnfortunately, when it comes to the animals and living things that Kazuki loves, he gets so immersed that he pays no attention to other things. He is not able to follow the rules established by the university and gets scolded at work every day. In addition, he has the habit of procrastinating on things that he finds bothersome and is also poor at being punctual. Kazuki’s university lectures are also not ordinary. Although he gives students assignments to make them express their opinions, he would end up saying that he does not know the right answer either and stump them. \n\nKazuki’s behaviour bewilders the people around him, and at times, it even irritates them. They keep this “eccentric” at a slight distance but this does not perturb him. However, their own values are shaken by the sight of Kazuki, who has no bias or preconceived ideas and enjoys each day following his interests and curiosity, and they are gradually influenced by him.",

As her country and family are teetering on the brink of disaster, she writes to implore the Prince of Nanchuan for help, promising anything in return as long as he sends his army to intervene. He eventually arrives, saving not just her husband and child, but her own self. Despite her aloofness, he hesitates to hurt her. Yet, his aid comes at a cost. His desire is not for the throne, but for one person's love.\n\n(Source: WeTV)\n\n~~ Adapted from the web novel \"Shou Ta Yi Bing\" (授他以柄) by Zhou Fu Yao (周扶妖).",

In the beginning, Ji Eun works as his maid in order to buy her house back. They alter their arrangement when Yeong Jae decides to win back the love of his life, Kang Hye Won. In a bid to make Hye Won jealous, the two protagonists enter into a contract marriage with a six-month term. Complications arise when the couple starts to fall for each other.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia; Edited by: unninette at MyDramaList)\n\n~~ Adapted from the manhwa “Full House” (풀하우스) by Won Su Yeon (원수연).",

Wang Qingnian helps a broken-down convoy out of danger. The convoy members include Western Region experts Professor Zhao and Lin Wan. Wang Qingnian and Li Erdan infiltrate the archaeological team as guides, and under Wang Qingnian's guidance, everyone finds their target. The bodies of the previous explorers are also found here. Lin Wan deduces that there is an ancient book among the relics that records the history of the ancient Loulan Kingdom. Wang Qingnian deciphers the book and discovers that Loulan was attacked by a terrifying demon, which the last king of Loulan defeated. The last king of Loulan then created a \"soul-suppressing coffin\" to seal the demon and himself together, of which lies beneath this very site… \n\n\n(Source:  IQIYI)",

Two young slaves, Ddol Bok and his friend Dam survive, but neither knows the other has. Ddol Bok blames the king and vows to kill him to avenge the deaths of everyone he loves. He spends several years becoming a great warrior. Dam, who has a photographic memory, becomes a court lady called So Yi, but she feels so guilty about her role in the other slaves' deaths that she is mute.\n\nDdol Bok returns to the palace under the name of Kang Chae Yoon in order to kill the king. However, he becomes embroiled in the mystery surrounding the deaths of several Hall of Worthies scholars. The deaths were caused by a secret society called \"Hidden Root,\" which was created long ago by followers of Jeong Do Jeon, with the goal of giving more power to ministers and less to the king. King Tae Jong killed Jeong Do Jeon and all of his family except his nephew, Jeong Gi Joon, who is now the leader of Hidden Root and lives in disguise not far from King Se Jong.",

Saruj Juthathep, son of M.R. Pavornruj and Princess Wanrasa, is the First Secretary of the Thai Embassy in Bern, whose job is to support Thai students. This is a perfect setting for romance, but not a love triangle. \n\nThings get complicated when Cheewan falls for Saruj while she is supposed to play Cupid for her Poncheewa and Saruj. They become entangled in a web of lies and jealousy that threatens to tear apart the cousins’ once unbreakable bond. Will Cheewan follow her heart and be one with Saruj, or will she remain loyal to Poncheewa? For whom does Saruj harbour true feelings?\n\n(Source: CH3+)\n\n~~ Adapted from the novel “Phon Cheewan” (พรชีวัน) by Rom Keaw (ร่มแก้ว).",

Both of them, who grew up in the 'snow', have been fighting hard for their dreams with hope since they were children. In the school, they both met Li Bing He, a girl from the city who has a bright and smart personality. The three of them eventually became close friends who shared one thing in common, a dream on the ice. Because of an accident, Tang Jian quit speed skating, and his dreams were shattered. Then, Yan Zhen Hua became a skating partner with Li Bing He. The two establish empathy as they go through many competitions together and, eventually, fall in love with each other. However, after various twists and turns, both of them decided to break up. Yan Zhen Hua turned into a short track speed skater to continue their dreams as the three eventually parted ways. \n\nStory 2 \"Winter Olympics Dream\"\nSet during the year 2019, when China is making adequate preparations for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. The story follows Yan Yang, the son of Yan Zhen Hua, who was selected from the local club for the short-track speed skating national Olympic training camp. In the camp, he met Jin Ying, Tang Han and other outstanding players, as well as coach Chen Jin and team doctor Li Nian Xue. He has worked hard, from sparring with female team skaters to being a full-time skater. His understanding of sportsmanship and the Olympic spirit has gradually deepened in his heart. After finding out his parent's story, he has become more determined in his dreams. The journey of the previous generation of Winter Olympics was full of regrets, but the skaters of the new era took over the baton and continued their dreams. \n\n(Source: acejoy at MyDramaList) \n\n~~ Dedicated to the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.",

Tamaki discovers she has cervical cancer just before her marriage to Takashi (Kenki Yamaguchi). Following surgical removal of her uterus and ovaries, Tamaki transforms from a happy, spirited young woman to a depressed recluse, unable to get out of bed or function as a housewife. Though he is supportive at first, the burden begins to weigh on Takashi. At the same time, he can’t get over the suspicion that Tamaki slept around before they met, and that this was the direct cause of her illness.",

      "synopsis": "27-year-old IT manager Boku Sato works for a market survey company. One night, his boss Fujima was devastated over the disappearance of his family and damages some equipment. Sato, on the other hand, spills coffee over the servers causing them to lose their client's data. Due to the incident, he was demoted and was tasked to give out questionnaires at the Sendai station. Nobody was willing to participate in filling out the survey except Saki, a woman in a recruit suit with the word \"shampoo\" on her hand.\n\nAnother story is of Minako, a 27-year-old beautician. Kasumi introduces her to Manabu, her younger brother, but all Manabu ever does is call Minako on the phone. While she does enjoy their conversations, Minako finds it hard to take the next step and they never actually go out together. Kasumi tells Minako he intends to ask her to be his girlfriend if he wins the boxing match.\n\n(Source: MyDramaList)\n\n~~ Adapted from the novel \"Eine kleine Nachtmusik\" (アイネクライネナハトムジーク) by Isaka Kotaro (伊坂幸太郎).",

      "synopsis": "A story about a lie that follows two close friends through the workplace where they encounter their past and open doors to a new love.\n\nShu Fei and Lin Fei are as close as sisters. During their college days, their senior Qi Ran becomes interested in Lin Fei, yet she doesn't have mutual feelings for him. Shu Fei who has a crush on Qi Ran has always been concerned with his wellbeing. Since she didn't want him to be sad, she uses Lin Fei's name to correspond with Qi Ran through letters.\nAfter graduation, Shu Fei and Lin Fei both find a job at the same television shopping network. Shu Fei gets on the wrong foot with Director Lan Tian whom she mistakenly thought to be a pervert. She also discovers that Qi Ran is their boss which puts her in an awkward position to witness Qi Ran giving all of his attention to Lin Fei. Shu Fei decides to focus on work instead and becomes closer with Lan Tian over time. Lin Fei has also devoted herself to work and she will do everything to succeed especially after she finds out that she can exploit the lie that Shu Fei told to her own advantage.",

      "synopsis": "On the day Lin Zhao Xi's father was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, she hears the news that her longtime crush was going abroad for further studies. Pei Zhi's relentlessness in the road of mathematics has made Lin Zhao Xi realize that she can never bridge the gap between herself and a true genius. However, two trips to a parallel world allows Lin Zhao Xi to discover her own potential. Lin Zhao Xi's life has been less than satisfactory after she graduated as a philosophy major. The seeds of mathematics have long been instilled deep inside her heart but she had no self confidence due to her longtime admiration for her father Old Lin and first love Chu Pei Zhi who are both math geniuses. Everything changes when she mysteriously travels through time and space. Coming to a parallel world for the first time, Lin Zhao Xi is only 12 years old here. \n\nThrough the help of Old Lin, she gives her all at the Mathematical Olympiad Summer Camp. In her second journey, she travels to her senior year of high school. Alongside Pei Zhi, she gradually musters up the courage to face life. Back in her own world, Lin Zhao Xi is preparing for her postgraduate exams while participating in modeling contests to help out her family through prize winnings. In order to help Old Lin who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, Lin Zhao Xi and Pei Zhi join hands to promote the research of the P=NP problem and climb to the pinnacle of mathematics together.\n\n(Source: Viki)\n\n~~ Adapted from the web novel \"Genius Fundamentals\" (天才基本法) by Zhang Er (长洱).",

In their interactions, Sen learns of Ling Yi's anguish after being abandoned by her boyfriend since she was imprisoned for accidentally causing someone's death. Despite having closed himself off emotionally, Sen finds himself genuinely drawn to this kind-hearted girl.\n\nOne day, Sen confesses to Ling Yi that he is an undercover police officer, who spent a decade infiltrating the Kuntai Group with the hope of eventually finding their criminal activities and bringing them to justice. Amidst perilous situations, Sen and Ling Yi's bond grows as they find solace in each other. They both promise to start afresh together once everything is over. \n\nWith Ling Yi's assistance, Sen covertly gathers crucial information about the Kuntai Group's dealings by getting close to Elena, Kun's wife, leading to the arrest of Kun and Elena and the subsequent collapse of the Kuntai Group. However, during the arrest, Tai, Kun's younger brother and the most unpredictable member of the Chen family, goes missing, causing concern for the police. Meanwhile, a conspiracy against Sen and Ling Yi quietly brews in the shadows...\n\n(Source: Chinese = Youku Youtube Channel || Translation = MyDramaList)\n\n~~ Adapted from the web novel \"Ai Zai Tian Yao Di Dong Shi\" (爱在天摇地动时) by Zong Zheng Da Ren (总攻大人).",

Samantha has had to fare on her own since she was young. For her, starting a family is riskier than starting a business because she must deal with Matt's family, including his brother, who has low self-esteem, and sister, who is in love with a playboy.\nMatt loves Samantha deeply and is even willing to admit to a crime and go to jail for her. A crisis emerges at their company. Not wanting Matt to be left with nothing when he is released from jail, Samantha uses her daughter to get close to her ex-boyfriend, Kenny.  Because of her excessive greed, she and Matt ultimately break up their partnership! The deeper the love, the deeper the hate, the two become enemies from then on...\n(Source: newjustvb.blogspot.com)",

In despair, Hu Ba Yi and Shirley Yang decided to risk their lives using the Sun-shooting wooden mechanism to lead everyone out of Guixu.\n\n(Source: WeTV)\n\n~~ Adapted from the 6th volume in the novel series \"Candle in the Tomb\" (鬼吹灯) by Zhang Mu Ye (天下霸唱).",

Fortunately for Ning, he was rescued by the Maoshan Taoist priest, Yan Chi Xia. Ning's near-death experience didn't deter him from falling in love with Xiao Qian. Instead, he tried to save her.\n\nHe found out that Xiao Qian was controlled by Lao Lao, a tree demon who used Xiao Qian to gather men's souls. Because Xiao Qian failed to obtain Ning's soul, Lao Lao punished her by marrying her to Heshen Lao Yao, a powerful skeleton demon.

But Bong Nam's lifelong dream has always been to sing. When he hears the news that the country's most popular singing contest will be held in his hometown, he takes part in the preliminary auditions without telling his wife Mi Ae.

      "synopsis": "The story begins with a dream sequence taken from a Tsuge story that gives the film its title. At a countryside bus stop, a man talks a strange woman into stripping in the midst of a driving rainstorm – the metal on her clothes will attract lightning, he tells her – and proceeds to rape her.\n\nThis disturbing scene abruptly shifts to an idyllic shot of the pair naked in front of a spectacular waterfall. Then the dreamer, Yoshio, awakens in early post-war Japan. The film later reenters his erotically charged dreamworld, if not with the same jarring impact as the first visit. A struggling manga artist, Yoshio, encounters a newly widowed Fukuko while helping his cranky old landlord move her out of her house.\n\nHe is attracted to this casually seductive woman, but soon learns she already has another man, a cagey would-be novelist named Imori who ropes Yoshio into a dubious sales scheme. When the scheme falls through, Yoshio puts the now desperate couple up in his tiny apartment... that, until Imori decides to leave...\n\n(Source: fareastfilm.com/eng)\n\n~~ Adapted from the short manga \"Ame no Naka no Yokujo\" (雨の中の慾情) by Tsuge Yoshiharu (つげ義春).\n~~ Co-production with Taiwan.\n~~ Release dates: Oct 30, 2024 (Festival) || Nov 29, 2024 (Cinema)",

      "synopsis": "In a realm dominated by martial arts experts, heroes, and villains, Hu Fei is a young, brave, justice-loving man on a quest for revenge. His father was killed, leaving him an orphan and thirsting for vengeance. During his quest, he encounters a tyrannical warlord who he believes has wronged him and others. But things get complicated when he then falls for that same warlord's daughter, the stunning Yuan Zi Yi.\n\nHu Fei begins to mature and also becomes involved in a mission to find a medical cure that will help restore the vision of his sworn uncle, legendary hero Miao Ren Fang, who he has long believed was responsible for his father’s death. While he searches for this medicine, he meets the young female apprentice of the Poison Hand Medicine King, a woman named Cheng Ling Su. She develops feelings for him, too, complicating matters of the heart.\n\nAs his journey leads him to meet more martial artists and learn from them, Hu Fei starts to suspect that his father's death did not quite happen in the way he originally believed. Will he ever learn the true identity of the killer? Where will his quest for justice ultimately lead? \n\n(Source: Viki; edited by MyDramaList)\n\n~~ Adapted from the novel \"The Young Flying Fox\" (飛狐外傳) by Jin Yong (金庸).",

She is not well off but is always shining and full of positivity. She dreams of becoming a poet, although she cannot attend school, and she is a bold character who doesn’t hide any emotions.\n\nGwan Sik is an extremely diligent and quiet character. Romance is not a strength for him, and he doesn’t know how to act if Ae Sun cries or laughs, but he is a silent warrior who only loves Ae Sun from the very beginning and pours his all into loving her.\n\n(Source: Korean = Newsen, Soompi || Translation = Wikipedia, MyDramaList)",

After this intriguing opening scene, we see a middle school boy and his younger sister, an elementary school girl, getting ready for school in a messy house with no adults around. In another house in the village, a high school boy is living alone in a desolate home.\n\nFragment follows the children of both the perpetrator and the victim, left alone in the world after a murder claimed their parents. The film breathlessly alternates between their lives, highlighting the contradictory and brutal existence they’ve been burdened with.\n\nBoth sides evoke pity and sorrow, and as we switch between them, we are swept up in a torrent of emotions. Embracing unbearable misfortune, these seemingly incompatible, vulnerable souls endure their lonely nights, and then, a kind of miracle happens.\n\n(Source: biff.kr)\n\n~~ Release dates: Oct 7, 2024 (Festival)",

One day, her sudden suicide attempt is foiled when rough-looking detective Hyung Jun takes her in his arms and saves her. He asks nothing, knowing that for some people, just being alive is hard enough. \n\nYoon Hee then goes looking for Hyung Jun, and from the moment she sees him, she feels that he already loves her deeply. Because she knows it is totally impossible to be free from her prison of marriage, the peace and happiness she feels at Hyung Jun's side are heartbreaking and frightening. Hyung Jun, used to his life of loneliness and despair, loves Yoon Hee at first sight, but as he can't do anything for her, he just lets her go. The only thing he can do is to offer her and himself some comfort.",

To escape him, she takes a trip to Howling Dog Creek village. There, she meets a country guy but does not know it is Poo Yai Lee.\nPoo Yai Lee falls in love with Ma instantly but is annoyed by city slicker personality, so he makes it a point to tease her.

After boarding the vessel, a team led by Cheung Wan Nam and including young hotshot Chow Ching Lai discover dead bodies of crew members and a huge cache of arms, including a valuable compass suited for use in a submarine. \n\nThe haul of weaponry, thought to have been swiped from Thailand, is carted off to a government ordnance depot for safekeeping. When Thai Interpol officers arrive for an inspection, the arms smugglers rush in. The raid results in casualties and shellshocked officers, causing a rapid escalation in response. Customs’ ports and intelligence branches, headed by Kwok Chi Keung and Athena Siu respectively, must work together and go international in catching the perpetrators. \n\nAppearing to be linked to a growing conflict in Africa, Chow and Thai agent Ying jet off to Loklamoa for to get a handle on how arms dealer Dr Raw is involved. The pair sense there’s a rat in Customs while back in Hong Kong investigators pin down the local shipping firm that’s in on the deal. Once the full picture emerges of how the arms turned up and where they’re headed, high drama is in store in Hong Kong’s Victoria Harbour. \n\n(Source: FarEastFilm.com) \n\n~~ Release dates: May 2, 2024 (Festival) || Jun 28, 2024 (Cinema)",

After realizing that the fundamental cure for these women is the Japanese government’s official statement of apology and compensation, Moon prepares for trial at her own expense. Finally, in 1998, after 6 long years, they faced the verdict of the Shimonoseki trial.\n\n(Source: KoBiz)",

His estranged son Bobby belongs to the new generation – one of fast cars, clubs, and avoiding consequences. When Bobby is held hostage by a group of over-privileged punks for scratching their car, Mr. Six bails him out and attempts to rebuild their relationship, while ignoring his worsening heart condition. But when the powerful, political family of the gang’s leader seeks revenge and beats Bobby into a coma, Mr. Six decides to rally his old comrades and settle the score with one last battle.  Starring acclaimed director Feng Xiaogang, stepping in front of the camera for the first time, MR. SIX is a film with both heart and grit.",

With Florida Banjeom, a popular Chinese restaurant, comfortably settled up on the roof, people from far and wide are always running in and out of the building. \n\nBut it’s not the constant stream of guests that has Hae Won concerned; it’s the fact that the restaurant’s owner and head chef, Baek Eun Kyu, seems to have a serious problem with him. Having been recommended for a part-time job at the restaurant by Cha Ji Soo, a fellow restaurant owner, Hae Won thought he would easily fit in with the staff; but for some reason, Eun Kyu seems to instantly dislike him. \n\nDespite the fact that he can’t figure out why his boss is so bothered by him, Hae Won finds himself fitting in nicely with his fellow staff members, Ha Jin and Joo Seo Hyuk. It isn’t long before he’s drawing as much attention from the restaurant patrons as his equally handsome co-workers.\n\n With such a good-looking staff, there’s never a shortage of admirers at the Florida Banjeom. It comes as no surprise to Hae Won that almost everyone who visits the restaurant eventually falls for the devastatingly handsome Eun Kyu. What does surprise him is when he realizes that he himself has fallen. But will he ever be able to win the heart of his cold-hearted boss? \n\n(Source: Viki)",

Yoo Mi Ji, the younger of the twins, has ended her short heyday as a promising track and field athlete and is currently living a free-spirited life. On the other hand, the older sister of the twins, Yoo Mi Rae, who has been walking the path of the elite since her school days, is a perfectionist working at a public corporation. The twins, physically identical but leading starkly different lives, embark on a bold charade, switching lives for some undisclosed reason. \n\nLee Ho Su is a lawyer at a large law firm with a tall appearance and a seemingly carefree attitude.

      "synopsis": "An entertainment masterpiece taken by Kosaburo Yoshimura, a newspaper novel written by Bunroku Choshi, divided into the first and second parts. The first part was released as “Minami no Kaze Mizue no Maki” (93 minutes), and the second part as “Southern Wind” (87 minutes). Like “Wakuryu”, Toshinori Sabe, Mieko Takamine, Mitsuko Mito, etc. appear, but this is a refreshing comedy that is rare during the war.\n\n\nThe protagonist is the son of a former baron performing Toshinobu Sabe. Growing up and living for a long time without any long-term work, an old friend who has performed in Singapore and performed by Tomokasa Kasa brings in a tale. It is a strange story that Takamori Saigo, who was thought to have died in the Southwest War, actually survived and started a new religion in Southeast Asia, and now his orphan is a guru. If I can spread the religion to Japan, I would be very interested in it and I would like to spend a lot of money aside from worrying about my surroundings.\n\n\nIt was a story like that, and it was also a funny story involving the love of Mieko Takamine and Mitsuko Mito, but it seems that the original is out of print now, the DVD has not yet appeared, and it is a bit disappointing Right. During the war, such a light story seemed unfathomable, or it may not have entered Kine seasonal best ten, but it may be a work that may be appreciated a little more.

An incident in Ren’s childhood triggered his thirst for power and he has his sights set on heading the police force by becoming its Superintendent General someday. Ren believes topping the faction that he belongs to is the shortcut to fulfilling his aspiration. He is driven by ambition and has no qualms carrying out work, no matter how dirty it is. His childhood friend Mizuki Sawa, a senior detective in the First Investigation Division, often opposes his stance and mindset as a detective but is the only one who knows about his past.\n\n(Source: jdramas.wordpress.com)",

Think about it, have you ever repayed this individual who once gave you warmth? Have you ever thought that maybe there was something you did that was probably hurting them? If there is something that you might be doing which is hurting them, then please hurry up and give some warmth to them as well. Change and do something good for them before the sunshine of your life has melted into the horizon forever. \n\n(Source: ThaiDramatic_update; edited by Soju at MyDramaList)",

      "synopsis": "In the glitzy realm of stardom, Ryu Seon Jae shines as a top-tier celebrity, captivating the spotlight since his debut. Despite the facade of a perfect life, the demanding nature of the entertainment industry has left him utterly exhausted. Im Sol, an ardent admirer, holds an affectionate love for Ryu Seon Jae. A childhood accident derailed her dreams, yet the solace found in Ryu Seon Jae's music on the radio transformed her into an unwavering fan.\n\nThe narrative takes a poignant turn when Im Sol, reeling from the breaking news of Ryu Seon Jae's tragic demise, experiences a miraculous twist of fate. Transported back 15 years into the past, she confronts Ryu Seon Jae in his 19-year-old high school self. Im Sol grapples with the formidable challenge of altering the trajectory of his future, driven by an unyielding determination to avert the impending tragedy.\n\n(Source: MyDramaList)\n\n~~ Adapted from the web novel “The Best of Tomorrow” (내일의 으뜸) by Kim Bbang (김빵).",

As Mo learns more about his neighbours, he finds himself knowing less and less about his wife. While the city's night is brightened by the countless lights from homes, there's darkness lurking in every household.\n\n(Source: makerville.hk/en)",

He then met Pop, a poor boy and classmate at school, and Hero pretended to be poor in order to get close to Pop.\n\nBut then, he found out that Pop was his stepmother's son. Problems lined up to get in their way, and both must use love to overcome class barriers and obstacles from those around them. Finally, both of them learned that teenage love is as addictive as heroin. They become addicted to each other without class and all conditions.\n\n(Source: WeTV)\n\n~~ Adapted from the novel \"Are You Addicted?\" (你丫上瘾了) by Chai Ji Dan (柴鸡蛋).",

Transferring to the company’s headquarters in Beijing, Zhou Rui is dazzled by the endless opportunities that await him. However, it doesn’t take long for him to realize that this glittering new life of his comes at a cost.\n\nDeprived of the sales team he personally trained, Zhou Rui has only his most trusted aide, Fang Wei, beside him. To make matters worse, Zhou Rui has recently been assigned an impossible task with an equally impossible deadline. With pressure mounting from his boss, Zhou Rui’s only hope of survival lies in landing a huge deal with one of the country’s most prestigious banks. Working against the odds, Zhou Rui approaches the bank with a lucrative offer, only to discover that their biggest competitor, Huikang, has been working on a deal with the bank for more than a year. As if to add insult to injury, Zhou Rui soon learns that heading up the opposition’s cutthroat team is none other than his first love, Luo Jia.\n\nOverwhelmed by impossible odds and distracted by Luo Jia’s sudden return to his life, Zhou Rui must find a way to rise above the opposition if he’s ever going to succeed. Will he be able to achieve the impossible, or will this life in the fast lane prove to be too much?\n\n(Source: Viki)\n\n~~ Adapted from the novel “Win or Lose” (输赢) by Fu Yao (付遥).",
